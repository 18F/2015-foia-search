## foia-search

A search/similarity/discovery API over information from FOIA responses.

The tentative plan for this repo is a Node/Elasticsearch service that will offer some kind of search and discovery interface for data and documents released publicly through the Freedom of Information Act.

There are many possible uses, and its role in integration with [foia-portal](https://github.com/18f/foia-portal) and [foia-core](https://github.com/18f/foia-core) is not fully fleshed out. Currently, it's being developed in parallel.
